## Greeting

## A musical interlude
The sun will come _out_ tomorrow.

Bet your bottom dollar...

When done with commits, make sure to run `git push` to move the code to GitHub

Standard Git REpos have a `README.md` at the root that describes developer instructions.

```js
var x = 1 + 2;

    <title>Your title here</title>

</head>
```
